# Football Player Management System

Football Player Management System is a backend application built using Java and Spring Boot to manage football players’ data.

The system provides RESTful APIs to perform CRUD operations on players, including adding, updating, retrieving, and deleting player records. Each player contains information such as name, team, nationality, and position.

The application uses MySQL with Spring Data JPA for data persistence and supports search and filtering functionality to query players by name, team, or nationality. The project follows a layered architecture and is managed using Maven.
